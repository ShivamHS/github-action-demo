  # For work-in-progress PRs you can typically use draft pull requests
  # from Github. However, private repositories on the free plan don't have
  # this option and therefore this action allows you to opt-in to using the
  # special "[WIP]" prefix to indicate this state. This will avoid the
  # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.
  # Note that a second check will be reported if this is enabled.
          wip: true
  # When using "Squash and merge" on a PR with only one commit, GitHub
  # will suggest using that commit message instead of the PR title for the
  # merge commit, and it's easy to commit this by mistake. Enable this option
  # to also validate the commit message for one commit PRs.
          validateSingleCommit: true
  # choose action the way to validate pr title
  # you can choose 'comment' | 'autofix'. default is 'comment'
  # comment: comment on pr when the validation was failed
